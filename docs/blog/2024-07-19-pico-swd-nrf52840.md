# Program nice!nano V2 clone with RPI Pico

The cheap nice!nano V2 clones sometimes comes without a bootloader, so it will not show up as a USB device when connected.

This is how you can flash a bootloader using a Raspberry Pi Pico as a SWD debugger. This will also with the original nice!nano V2, but shown on the pictures is the cheap

1. Prerequisites:
   1. Install xpm, see https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/
   1. Create a directory and cd in to it
      ```sh
      mkdir nice-nano
      cd nice-nano
      ```
   1. Initialize xpm and install OpenOcd
      ```sh
      xpm init
      xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest --verbose
      ```
      More info: https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/openocd/install/
   1. Make sure your Raspberry Pi Pico has the debugger firmware installed, see [previous blog post](blog/2024-07-18-raspberry-pi-pico-as-swd.md)
1. Download the [bootloader hex](https://nicekeyboards.com/assets/nice_nano_bootloader-0.6.0_s140_6.1.1.hex)
   This link was found on the [Nice Nano 2 Troubleshooting page](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-nano/troubleshooting)
1. Connect the Pico to the Nice Nano 2 clone according to the schematics below
   ![Raspberry Pi Pico connecting to nice!nano V2 clone](./images/pico-debug-nice-nano.svg)
   The 100Î© resistors can be omitted, see [previous blog post](blog/2024-07-18-raspberry-pi-pico-as-swd.md)
1. Insert the Pico in to the computer using a USB cable
1. Execute this command. First it unlocks the device, using the `nrf52_recover` command, it then flashes the bootloader.
   Note! Specify the path to the downloaded hex file. The command below assumes the hex file is in the same directory as the command is executed from (`nice-nano` directory).

   ```sh
   openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/nrf52.cfg  \
     -c "gdb_flash_program enable"  \
     -c "gdb_breakpoint_override hard"  \
     -c "init"  \
     -c "nrf52_recover"  \
     -c "reset halt"  \
     -c "flash write_image erase ./nice_nano_bootloader-0.6.0_s140_6.1.1.hex"
   ```

   Note! the command should be on one line, it is split here for readability. If executing on Windows, remove the backslashes.

   The output should look something like this:

1. Press <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd> to terminate the openocd session
1. The nice!nano V2 clone should contain the bootloader, and should show up as a USB device when connected to the computer.
